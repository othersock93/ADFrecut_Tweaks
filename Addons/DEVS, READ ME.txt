The file structure to follow is:

ADF_Folder
	adfrc_item (for instance, adfrc_blackhawk, adfrc_helmets, adfrc_men_amcu etc)

Please make sure every addon requires ADF_Core in its cfgPatches. We can keep adding to the Core PBO for things that are used mod-wide such as #defines and scripts

Due to some old ADFU models remaining binarised (and some other mod repacks), here is a list of addons we cant pack with mikeros:
- ADF_Air (due to Chinook and Blackhawk)
- ADF_Land (due to ASLAV, Bushmaster and Landrover)
- ADF_Weapons (most guns are binarised)
There might be a way for us to binarise and protect our assets whilst leaving the old stuff the way it is, but i havent found it yet.
